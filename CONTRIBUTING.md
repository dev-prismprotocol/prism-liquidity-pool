# Contributing to Prism Protocol

We welcome contributions to Prism Protocol! This document provides guidelines for contributing to our institutional-grade AMM infrastructure.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a professional and respectful environment that fosters collaboration and innovation in DeFi infrastructure development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Solana CLI 1.16 or higher
- Anchor Framework 0.28.0
- Node.js 18+ and yarn
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/liquidity-pool.git
   cd liquidity-pool
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Build the program:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **Rust**: Follow standard Rust conventions and use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- **Documentation**: All public functions must have comprehensive documentation
- **Testing**: New features require corresponding test cases
- **Security**: All code must pass security review standards

### Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following this format:
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `security`: Security improvements

Example:
```
feat(swap): implement advanced slippage protection

Add comprehensive slippage calculation and validation
for institutional-grade swap operations
```

## Contribution Process

### 1. Issue Creation

Before starting work:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplication
- Create an issue describing the proposed change
- Wait for maintainer feedback before beginning implementation

### 2. Pull Request Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**:
    - Follow coding standards
    - Add comprehensive tests
    - Update documentation
    - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): your change description"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
    - Create pull request from your fork
    - Fill out the PR template completely
    - Link any related issues

### 3. Review Process

- Maintainers will review code quality, security, and functionality
- Address any requested changes promptly
- All discussions should remain professional and constructive
- Approval from core maintainers required before merge

## Types of Contributions

### Security Improvements
- Enhance existing security measures
- Add new validation layers
- Improve error handling
- Mathematical safety improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduce computational complexity
- Optimize memory usage
- Improve transaction efficiency
- Mathematical precision enhancements

### Feature Enhancements
- New administrative functions
- Enhanced pool management
- Improved event emissions
- Additional query capabilities

### Documentation
- Code documentation improvements
- Integration guides
- API documentation
- Security documentation

### Testing
- Unit test coverage expansion
- Integration test improvements
- Edge case validation
- Performance benchmarks

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
All new functions must include unit tests covering:
- Normal operation scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error conditions and validation
- Mathematical precision verification

### Integration Tests
Complex features require integration tests:
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Multi-instruction transaction testing
- Real-world scenario simulation

### Security Testing
Security-related changes require:
- Authorization validation tests
- Input sanitization verification
- Overflow condition testing
- Attack vector analysis

## Security Considerations

### Secure Development
- Never commit private keys or sensitive data
- All mathematical operations must use safe arithmetic
- Input validation required for all user-provided data
- Authority checks must be comprehensive

### Code Review Focus
Security reviews will examine:
- Access control mechanisms
- Mathematical safety and precision
- Input validation completeness
- State consistency guarantees

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```rust
/// Brief description of function purpose
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `param1` - Description of parameter
/// * `param2` - Description of parameter
/// 
/// # Returns
/// Description of return value
/// 
/// # Errors
/// Description of possible errors
/// 
/// # Security
/// Any security considerations
pub fn example_function(param1: u64, param2: &str) -> Result<u64> {
    // Implementation
}
```
