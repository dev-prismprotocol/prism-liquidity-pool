- **High Performance**: Optimized swap calculations with mathematical precision and overflow protection
- **Institutional Controls**: Advanced pool management and administrative functions
- **Professional Events**: Comprehensive DEX event metadata for aggregator integration
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built with institutional reporting and audit requirements

### Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Solana Mainnet
- **Framework**: Anchor 0.28.0
- **Language**: Rust
- **Token Standard**: SPL Token Program
- **Program ID**: `G7G2o7vaMvacSkMENdBjqjECjpK3USBpDmSzpDo6JWrf`

## Program Instructions

### Core Liquidity Operations
- `create_pool` - Initialize institutional liquidity pool with virtual reserves
- `add_liquidity` - Deposit SOL and token assets to pool reserves
- `remove_liquidity` - Withdraw all assets from pool (authority only)

### Trading Operations
- `swap_tokens_for_sol` - Execute token-to-SOL swaps with program authority
- `swap_sol_for_tokens` - Execute SOL-to-token swaps with program authority

### Administrative Functions
- `update_exchange_rate` - Modify pool exchange rate parameters (authority only)
- `toggle_pool` - Enable/disable pool operations (authority only)
- `close_pool` - Safely shutdown and recover all liquidity (authority only)

### Information Queries
- `get_pool_info` - Retrieve comprehensive pool status and configuration
- `calculate_swap` - Preview swap calculations before execution

## Architecture

### Pool State Management
```rust
pub struct LiquidityPool {
    pub authority: Pubkey,           // Pool administrator
    pub token_mint: Pubkey,          // SPL token mint address
    pub exchange_rate: u64,          // Current exchange rate (tokens per SOL)
    pub sol_reserve: u64,            // Virtual SOL reserves
    pub token_reserve: u64,          // Virtual token reserves
    pub is_active: bool,             // Pool operational status
    pub created_at: i64,             // Creation timestamp
    pub fee_basis_points: u16,       // Trading fees (basis points)
    pub total_volume_sol: u64,       // Cumulative SOL volume
    pub total_volume_token: u64,     // Cumulative token volume
    pub trade_count: u64,            // Total number of trades
    pub current_price: f64,          // Current price tracking
}
```

### Security Model
- **Program Authority**: Cryptographic signature validation for swap operations
- **Pool Authority**: Administrative control for pool management functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter sanitization and bounds checking
- **Mathematical Safety**: Overflow protection and precision handling
- **State Protection**: Atomic transaction guarantees and rent exemption management
